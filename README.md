# Python Basic Calculator

This is a simple Python calculator that supports the four basic mathematical operations: **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **division (/)**.

The program allows you to perform multiple operations sequentially, where each result can be used in the next calculation.

## Features
- **Basic operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- **Error handling**: The program handles invalid inputs and division by zero.
- **Continuous calculation**: After each calculation, you can enter new numbers and continue working with the result.

## Usage
1. **Start the program** by entering a number when prompted.
2. Enter a second number and choose an operation from the supported options:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
3. **Continue** performing operations by entering new numbers and operators. Type `C` to stop the calculations.
4. The calculator displays results rounded to 5 decimal places.
5. **Invalid inputs**: If you enter a non-numeric value or an unsupported operator, the program will stop.
6. **Division by zero**: If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will return an error message and stop.

## Example

```bash
Supported operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)

Results will be shown with a maximum of 5 decimal places

Enter the first number: 1
Enter the next number: 2
Which operation would you like to perform? /
Calculate: 1 / 2
Answer: 0.5

Press ENTER to continue or type C to exit.
